          Hey there! I’m Joe, a 23-year-old fullstack software engineer who’s
          transitioned into Minecraft modpack development and aspiring pixel
          artist. My coding journey began at around 12 when I discovered Roblox.
          I was instantly captivated by the idea of creating something and
          sharing it with others. Growing up watching YouTube, I always aspired
          to be like the creators I admired. This led me to explore video
          creation and live streaming during my teenage years. With a foundation
          in Java development and skills from my YouTube days, I started making
          TikTok videos to promote BigChadGuys Plus. What began as a project for
          my partner and friends quickly evolved into a full-time passion.
          Initially, I had no idea that modpacks were even a thing, so I was
          overly confident about the product I was promoting. Immersing myself
          in a community I was unfamiliar with, I soon realized my project
          wasn’t quite up to par. After a brief hiatus, I returned with a
          revamped version I could truly be proud of. Following extensive custom
          content creation, countless hours of testing, answering questions, and
          bug fixing, I published the new BigChadGuys Plus. And that is probably
          what I’m focused on right now.
